        <h1>Ghost Bikes in Queens</h1>
        <p>Traffic violence is an all too common experience in New York City, but after a crash is cleaned up, what's left? The violence is hidden, the infrastructure resumes its seemingly neutral existence, the streets continue to be dominated by cars, and the cycle repeats itself. Ghost bikes—bikes that have been painted white and placed near the site where a cyclist was killed—stand in opposition to this cylce. They serve as both a memorial and a call to action. In her essay  Becoming Traffic: Critical Mass, Visual Resistance and the Ghost Bike , Debra Levine says, "The [ghost] bike demands that pedestrians stop and attend to it; it allows us to recall that our city streets are not just conduits for the movement of goods and labor. The bike triggers an empathic response that demands that we interrogate the undisputed dominance of motor vehicle traffic on city streets."</p>
        <p>There is a disconnect between how maps show us space and how we really experience it. I aim to show where traffic violence has happened against cyclists in Queens, and I want to take a moment to let users virtually attend to these spaces where ghost bike memorials have been placed and reflect on the lives that were taken and how we can imagine safer, better streets that are for people and not just cars.</p>
        <p>There have been more than 50 ghost bikes installed in Queens since 2005. I have started visiting them and recording short videos. I will create a bike tour of the spots I've visited thus far and anchor the videos to the memorial locations, along with information about the cyclist. I also hope to include recent crash data from NYC Open Data, as well as information about the bike lane infrastructure (or lack thereof) in the borough.</p>
        <p>I already have CSV files about crash data and blocked bike lane complaints between July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022. I also have a csv file for all Queens ghost bike locations. I need to conver these to JSONs.</p>
